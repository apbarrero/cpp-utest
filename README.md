# C++ Unit Testing

This repository provides the basic building infrastructure to perform code katas in C++, so you can focus on coding and don't have to bother about compilation scripts.

To checkout the starting point for each kata, checkout the corresponding tag. (`$ git tag` for a full list).

    $ git checkout <KATA_NAME>

There is no kata solution here, just a good starting point.

## Requirements

* [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) >= 2.8
* A c++11 compatible compiler, e.g. [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) >= 4.7

## Build

    $ cd build/
    $ cmake [options] ..
    $ make
